1. Orbital Mechanics, Space Travel, Cosmology, Relativity, Black Holes

2. Orbital Mechanics: https://spsweb.fltops.jpl.nasa.gov/portaldataops/mpg/MPG_Docs/MPG%20Book/Release/Chapter7-OrbitalMechanics.pdf
 - this source describes the fundamental equations of orbital mecanics as well as a general overview of the subject.
Relativity: https://profoundphysics.com/special-relativity-for-dummies-an-intuitive-introduction/
 - this article explains the basic concepts and equations of special relativity. There is also a companion article that does the same but for general relativity (which isn't as in depth because the math behind it is harder).
Black Holes: https://www.astro.puc.cl/BlackCAT/
- this is a catalogue that contains relatively updated information on stellar-mass black holes.

3. Relativity: I could create a video game in which you could use time dilation / length contraction to achieve specific objectives. I could make functions for equations in relativity that describe time dilation, apply those to whatever speed / acceleration the player wants their ship to have.

4. Dream version: My dream version would be a sort of puzzle game relating to spaceflight, where the player can change the mass of the ship, how much it accelerates, and nearby massive objects like black holes. The player would use the principles of relativity to achieve specific objectives (to age something by a certain amount for example).
Simpler version: For a simpler version, I could ignore anything relating to general relativity and just use special relaitivity. I could have a system where you have to make a certain number of trips, and you only have so long to do it, but you also have a limited amount of energy. The goal would be to reach all the destinations within a certain amount of time (for the traveler), without using an excessive amount of energy. This would be simpler, especially if it is only in 1 spatial dimension.
